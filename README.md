# 📈 Stock Price Prediction System

A machine learning–driven stock prediction project built using **Jupyter Notebook** and popular Python ML libraries. This project explores historical stock market data, applies data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, and trains predictive models to forecast future stock prices or trends.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Financial markets are complex, noisy, and influenced by countless variables. This project takes a data-driven approach to understanding stock price movements by:

* Analyzing historical stock data
* Identifying patterns and trends
* Training machine learning models to make predictions

The system is designed to be **modular**, **experiment-friendly**, and easy to extend with new models or datasets.

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models and evaluation
* **TensorFlow / Keras** *(optional)* – deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)
* **Yahoo Finance / CSV datasets** – historical stock data

---

## 🔍 Features

* Historical stock data analysis
* Data cleaning and normalization
* Feature engineering (moving averages, returns, volatility)
* Machine learning models such as:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  * LSTM (for time-series forecasting)
* Model performance evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²
* Visual comparison of predicted vs actual prices

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-system.git
cd stock-prediction-system
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   Historical stock prices are sourced from CSV files or APIs such as Yahoo Finance.

2. **Preprocessing**
   Missing values are handled, data is normalized, and time-based features are created.

3. **Model Training**
   Multiple machine learning models are trained and compared to identify the best-performing approach.

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**
   Predictions are evaluated and visualized against actual stock prices.

## 📊 Sample Results

* Clear visualization of stock trends
* Comparison between actual and predicted prices
* Model evaluation metrics displayed for transparency

*(Results may vary depending on stock selected, time range, and model used.)*

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time stock data
* Add sentiment analysis from financial news and social media
* Deploy as a web app (Streamlit / Flask)
* Improve deep learning architectures
* Support multi-stock portfolio prediction
